## How to Use
1. Put the json files of every game in the tour into the json folder (like you would on iamasiannoob/sakurapianist's stats report script)
2. If you're running a Windows Operating system, Run the ``run.bat`` file
3. IF you're running a Linux Operating System with a GNOME-based desktop, Right-click on the ``run_gnome.sh`` file and choose ``Run as a program``

## Notes
- This script doesn't store the result of each run, meaning every time you close the terminal window the fun stats are gone forever. This may or may not change in the future depending on the needs ~~and my mood~~
- If you ran it on GNOME-based Linux OSes, you may need to close the terminal window manually (since I don't know how to make it so automatically terminate upon any key pressed yet)
